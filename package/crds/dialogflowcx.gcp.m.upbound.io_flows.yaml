                      A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
                      They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
                      They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                      Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                      They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
                      They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                      Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

                      They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
                      They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                      Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

                                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.
