                      It is only applicable if the valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or
                      DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored
                      metric values. Different systems may scale the values to be
                      more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02KBy might be displayed
                      as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy).
                      However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is
                      always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                      If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds
                      used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose
                      unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job
                      uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.
                      Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in
                      a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric
                      whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which
                      is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).
                      The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units
                      of Measure standard. More info can be found in the API documentation
                      (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors).

                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier

                  are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same
                  fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to avoid

                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after
                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                      It is only applicable if the valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or
                      DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored
                      metric values. Different systems may scale the values to be
                      more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02KBy might be displayed
                      as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy).
                      However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is
                      always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                      If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds
                      used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose
                      unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job
                      uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.
                      Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in
                      a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric
                      whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which
                      is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).
                      The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units
                      of Measure standard. More info can be found in the API documentation
                      (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors).

                      The relative metric name must have only upper and lower-case

                      the maximum number of characters allowed for the relative_metric_name
                      is 100. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com,

                      It is only applicable if the valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or
                      DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored
                      metric values. Different systems may scale the values to be
                      more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02KBy might be displayed
                      as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy).
                      However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is
                      always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                      If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds
                      used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose
                      unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job
                      uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.
                      Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in
                      a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric
                      whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which
                      is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).
                      The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units
                      of Measure standard. More info can be found in the API documentation
