                      There are two types of locations, regional or multi-regional. A regional
                      location is a specific geographic place, such as Tokyo, and a multi-regional
                      location is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that
                      contains at least two geographic places.
                      The default value is multi-regional location US.
                      Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
                  and password required to connect to the managed resource.
                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.

                      table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
                      If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the
                      table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when
