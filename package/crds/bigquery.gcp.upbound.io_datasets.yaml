                      location is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that
                      contains at least two geographic places.
                      The default value is multi-regional location US.

                      the dataset will have an expirationMs property in the timePartitioning
                      settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
                      affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
                      have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
                      Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs
                      for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and
                      defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned
                      table. If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when
                      creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence

                      Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset
                      will have an expirationTime property set to the creation time plus
                      the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
                      new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given
                      table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
                      If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the
                      table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when
                      creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default
