                                  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                                    Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about.
                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.

                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                              Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.

                                              Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                              Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                    Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about.
                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.

                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                                                    Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about.
                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.
                                                    You may set this, for example:

                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                    Represents info card response. If the response contains generative knowledge prediction, Dialogflow will return a payload with Infobot Messenger compatible info card.
                                    Otherwise, the info card response is skipped.

                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
