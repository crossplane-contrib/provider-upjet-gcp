                                  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                                    Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about.
                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.

                                                    Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                        Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                              Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.

                                              Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                                              Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way.

                                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.

                                      Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about.
                                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.

                                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
                                      You may set this, for example:
