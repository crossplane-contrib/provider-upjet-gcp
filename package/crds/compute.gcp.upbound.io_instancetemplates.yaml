                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                      An instance template is a global resource that is not
                      bound to a zone or a region. However, you can still specify some regional
                      resources in an instance template, which restricts the template to the
                      region where that resource resides. For example, a custom subnetwork
                      resource is tied to a specific region. Defaults to the region of the
                      Provider if no value is given.
