                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier

                  are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same
                  fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to avoid

                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.
