                            will create a diff, even if the JSON itself hasn't changed. If the API returns
                            a different value for the same schema, e.g. it switched the order of values
                            or replaced STRUCT field type with RECORD field type, we currently cannot
                            suppress the recurring diff this causes. As a workaround, we recommend using
                            the schema as returned by the API.

                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.
