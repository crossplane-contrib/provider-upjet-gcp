                                                    to the surrogate by prefixing

                                                    The following scheme defines the

                                                    For example, if the name of custom
                                                    infoType is ''MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE''

                                                    the full replacement value will
                                                    be: ''MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc''
                                                    This annotation identifies the
                                                    surrogate when inspecting content
                                                    using the custom infoType SurrogateType.
                                                    This facilitates reversal of the

                                                    to work properly, the name of
                                                    this infoType must not occur naturally
                                                    anywhere in your data; otherwise,
                                                    inspection may find a surrogate
                                                    that does not correspond to an
                                                    actual identifier. Therefore,
                                                    choose your custom infoType name
                                                    carefully after considering what
                                                    your data looks like. One way

                                                    to exist in your data. For example,
                                                    assuming your data is entered
                                                    from a regular ASCII keyboard,

                  enabled, and may be changed or removed without notice. InitProvider
                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier
                  and other resource reference fields. The fields that are in InitProvider
                  are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same
                  fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to avoid
                  updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after
                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                                                    The following scheme defines the
                                                    format: info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate
                                                    For example, if the name of custom
                                                    infoType is ''MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE''
                                                    and the surrogate is ''abc'',
                                                    the full replacement value will
                                                    be: ''MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc''
                                                    This annotation identifies the
                                                    surrogate when inspecting content
                                                    using the custom infoType SurrogateType.
                                                    This facilitates reversal of the
                                                    surrogate when it occurs in free
                                                    text. In order for inspection
                                                    to work properly, the name of
                                                    this infoType must not occur naturally
                                                    anywhere in your data; otherwise,
                                                    inspection may find a surrogate
                                                    that does not correspond to an
                                                    actual identifier. Therefore,
                                                    choose your custom infoType name
                                                    carefully after considering what
                                                    your data looks like. One way
                                                    to select a name that has a high
                                                    chance of yielding reliable detection
                                                    is to include one or more unicode
                                                    characters that are highly improbable
                                                    to exist in your data. For example,
                                                    assuming your data is entered
                                                    from a regular ASCII keyboard,
                                                    the symbol with the hex code point
                                                    29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

                                                    to work properly, the name of
                                                    this infoType must not occur naturally

                                                    inspection may find a surrogate
                                                    that does not correspond to an

                                                    choose your custom infoType name
                                                    carefully after considering what

                                                    to exist in your data. For example,

                                                    from a regular ASCII keyboard,
