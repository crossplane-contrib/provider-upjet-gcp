                                  Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs.
                                  For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must
                                  recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0
                                  means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.
