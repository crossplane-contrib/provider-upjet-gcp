                      Graceful decommissioning allows removing nodes from the cluster without interrupting jobs in progress.
                      Timeout specifies how long to wait for jobs in progress to finish before forcefully removing nodes (and potentially interrupting jobs).
                      Default timeout is 0 (for forceful decommission), and the maximum allowed timeout is 1 day. (see JSON representation of
                      Duration).
                      Only supported on Dataproc image versions 1.2 and higher.

                      Does not affect auto scaling decomissioning from an autoscaling policy.
                      Graceful decommissioning allows removing nodes from the cluster without interrupting jobs in progress.
                      Timeout specifies how long to wait for jobs in progress to finish before forcefully removing nodes (and potentially interrupting jobs).
                      Default timeout is 0 (for forceful decommission), and the maximum allowed timeout is 1 day. (see JSON representation of
                      Duration).
                      Only supported on Dataproc image versions 1.2 and higher.

                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                      Does not affect auto scaling decomissioning from an autoscaling policy.
                      Graceful decommissioning allows removing nodes from the cluster without interrupting jobs in progress.
                      Timeout specifies how long to wait for jobs in progress to finish before forcefully removing nodes (and potentially interrupting jobs).
                      Default timeout is 0 (for forceful decommission), and the maximum allowed timeout is 1 day. (see JSON representation of
                      Duration).
                      Only supported on Dataproc image versions 1.2 and higher.
