                                Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC) is a virtual network interface.
                                Installing the gVNIC driver allows for more efficient traffic transmission across the Google network infrastructure.
                                gVNIC is an alternative to the virtIO-based ethernet driver. GKE nodes must use a Container-Optimized OS node image.
