                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier

                  are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same

                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                            GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
                            However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable
                            certain features such as GPUs. Taint values can be updated
                            safely in Kubernetes (eg. through kubectl), and it's recommended
                            that you do not use this field to manage taints. If you
                            do, lifecycle.ignore_changes is recommended. Structure
