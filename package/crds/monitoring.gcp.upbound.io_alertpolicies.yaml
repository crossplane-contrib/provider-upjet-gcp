                                      description: The set of fields to preserve when
                                        crossSeriesReducer is specified. The groupByFields
                                        determine how the time series are partitioned
                                        into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                        function. Each subset contains time series
                                        that have the same value for each of the grouping
                                        fields. Each individual time series is a member
                                        of exactly one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                                        is applied to each subset of time series.
                                        It is not possible to reduce across different
                                        resource types, so this field implicitly contains
                                        resource.type. Fields not specified in groupByFields
                                        are aggregated away. If groupByFields is not
                                        specified and all the time series have the
                                        same resource type, then the time series are
                                        aggregated into a single output time series.
                                        If crossSeriesReducer is not defined, this
                                        field is ignored.

                                  When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in
                                  mind the frequency of the underlying time series
                                  data (which may also be affected by any alignments
                                  specified in the aggregations field); a good duration
                                  is long enough so that a single outlier does not
                                  generate spurious alerts, but short enough that
                                  unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly.
