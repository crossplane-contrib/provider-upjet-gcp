                      expires and before the message is acknowledged, it is an outstanding
                      message and will not be delivered again during that time (on

                      used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override
                      this value for a given message, call subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline
                      with the corresponding ackId if using pull. The minimum custom

                      is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery,

                      to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the

                            The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which
                            you can use to change the format of the pushed message.

                            by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed
                            message (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint
                            version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API. If
