                      provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
                      snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
                      Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                      the disk.
                      If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                      the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
