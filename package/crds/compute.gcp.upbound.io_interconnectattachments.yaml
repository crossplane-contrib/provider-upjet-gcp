                      /27, etc). Google will attempt to select an unused /29 from
                      the supplied candidate prefix(es). The request will fail if
                      all possible /29s are in use on Google's edge. If not supplied,
                      Google will randomly select an unused /29 from all of link-local
                      space.

                      the VPN gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address

                      be allocated from regional external IP address pool.
