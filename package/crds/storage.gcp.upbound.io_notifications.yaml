                  specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to take on the
                  managed and external resources. This field is planned to replace
                  the DeletionPolicy field in a future release. Currently, both could
                  be set independently and non-default values would be honored if
                  the feature flag is enabled. If both are custom, the DeletionPolicy
                  field will be ignored. See the design doc for more information:
