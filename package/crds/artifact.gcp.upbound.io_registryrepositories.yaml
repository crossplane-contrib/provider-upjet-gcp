                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
