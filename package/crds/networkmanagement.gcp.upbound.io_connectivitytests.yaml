                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception
                  of Identifier and other resource reference fields. The fields that are
                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                      endpoint, project ID, or VPC network to identify the source location.
                      Reachability analysis might proceed even if the source location is
                      ambiguous. However, the test result might include endpoints or use a source
                      that you don't intend to test.
