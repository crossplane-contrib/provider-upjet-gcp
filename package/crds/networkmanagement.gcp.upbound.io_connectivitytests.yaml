                      Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                      destination location. Even if the destination IP address is
                      not unique, the source IP location is unique. Usually, the analysis
                      can infer the destination endpoint from route information. If
                      the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance
                      has multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify
                      either a destination IP address or VPC network to identify the
                      destination interface. A reachability analysis proceeds even
                      if the destination location is ambiguous. However, the result
                      can include endpoints that you don't intend to test. Structure

                      identify the source location. Examples: If the source IP address
                      is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud Virtual Private
                      Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the VPC network.
                      Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its
                      internal IP address and VPC network information. If the source
                      of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must
                      provide the destination VPC network. If the source endpoint
                      is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple network interfaces,
                      the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the endpoint.
                      So, you must also specify the source IP address or VPC network.
                      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location
                      is ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints
