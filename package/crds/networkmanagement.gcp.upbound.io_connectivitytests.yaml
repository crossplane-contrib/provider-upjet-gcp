                      You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
                      Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                      destination location.
                      Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                      location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                      endpoint from route information.
                      If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                      multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                      destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                      interface.
                      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                      is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
                      don't intend to test.

                      Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
                      You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                      (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                      source location.
                      Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                      a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
                      also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                      which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                      information.
                      If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                      you must provide the destination VPC network.
                      If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                      network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                      identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                      address or VPC network.
                      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                      ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
                      you don't intend to test.

                      You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
                      Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                      destination location.
                      Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                      location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                      endpoint from route information.
                      If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                      multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                      destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                      interface.
                      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                      is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
                      don't intend to test.

                      Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
                      You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                      (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                      source location.
                      Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                      a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
                      also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                      which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                      information.
                      If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                      you must provide the destination VPC network.
                      If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                      network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                      identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                      address or VPC network.
                      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                      ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
                      you don't intend to test.

                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                      Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                      destination location.
                      Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                      location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                      endpoint from route information.
                      If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                      multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                      destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                      interface.
                      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                      is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you

                      Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
                      You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                      (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                      source location.
                      Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                      a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
                      also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                      which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                      information.
                      If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                      you must provide the destination VPC network.
                      If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                      network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                      identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                      address or VPC network.
                      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                      ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
