                      The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value
                      identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent
                      disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image
                      that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                      image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used.
