                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception

                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It will be honored

                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception
                  of Identifier and other resource reference fields. The fields that are
                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                      etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous
                      updates of a backup plan from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that
                      systems make use of the 'etag' in the read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlan updates
                      in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to backupPlans.get,
                      and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to backupPlans.patch or
                      backupPlans.delete to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource.
