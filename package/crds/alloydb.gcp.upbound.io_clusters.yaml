                      Deleting a cluster forcefully, deletes the cluster and all its associated instances within the cluster.
                      Deleting a Secondary cluster with a secondary instance REQUIRES setting deletion_policy = "FORCE" otherwise an error is returned. This is needed as there is no support to delete just the secondary instance, and the only way to delete secondary instance is to delete the associated secondary cluster forcefully which also deletes the secondary instance.

                      Deleting a cluster forcefully, deletes the cluster and all its associated instances within the cluster.
                      Deleting a Secondary cluster with a secondary instance REQUIRES setting deletion_policy = "FORCE" otherwise an error is returned. This is needed as there is no support to delete just the secondary instance, and the only way to delete secondary instance is to delete the associated secondary cluster forcefully which also deletes the secondary instance.
