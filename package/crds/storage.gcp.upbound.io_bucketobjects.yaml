                    description: Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based
                      hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which
                      is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to
                      false). After being released (set to false), such objects will
                      be subject to bucket-level retention (if any).
