                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier

                  are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same
                  fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to avoid

                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after
                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                            Zones that support Bigtable instances are noted on the

                      to leave this field unspecified since the distinction between
                      "DEVELOPMENT" and "PRODUCTION" instances is going away, and
                      all instances will become "PRODUCTION" instances. This means
                      that new and existing "DEVELOPMENT" instances will be converted
                      to "PRODUCTION" instances. It is recommended for users to use
                      "PRODUCTION" instances in any case, since a 1-node "PRODUCTION"
                      instance is functionally identical to a "DEVELOPMENT" instance,
                      but without the accompanying restrictions.
