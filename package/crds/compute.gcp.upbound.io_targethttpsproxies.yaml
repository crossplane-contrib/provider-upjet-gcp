                      Specifies the QUIC override policy for this resource. This determines
                      whether the load balancer will attempt to negotiate QUIC with clients
                      or not. Can specify one of NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. If NONE is
                      specified, Google manages whether QUIC is used.
                      Default value is NONE.
                      Possible values are: NONE, ENABLE, DISABLE.

                      A URL referring to a networksecurity.ServerTlsPolicy
                      resource that describes how the proxy should authenticate inbound
                      traffic. serverTlsPolicy only applies to a global TargetHttpsProxy
                      attached to globalForwardingRules with the loadBalancingScheme
                      set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL or EXTERNAL_MANAGED.
                      For details which ServerTlsPolicy resources are accepted with
                      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and which with EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED
                      loadBalancingScheme consult ServerTlsPolicy documentation.
                      If left blank, communications are not encrypted.
                      If you remove this field from your configuration at the same time as
                      deleting or recreating a referenced ServerTlsPolicy resource, you will
                      receive a resourceInUseByAnotherResource error. Use lifecycle.create_before_destroy
                      within the ServerTlsPolicy resource to avoid this.

                      Currently, you may specify up to 15 SSL certificates. sslCertificates do not apply when the load balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
                      sslCertificates and certificateManagerCertificates can not be defined together.

                      Specifies whether TLS 1.3 0-RTT Data (“Early Data”) should be accepted for this service.
                      Early Data allows a TLS resumption handshake to include the initial application payload
                      (a HTTP request) alongside the handshake, reducing the effective round trips to “zero”.
                      This applies to TLS 1.3 connections over TCP (HTTP/2) as well as over UDP (QUIC/h3).
                      Possible values are: STRICT, PERMISSIVE, UNRESTRICTED, DISABLED.
