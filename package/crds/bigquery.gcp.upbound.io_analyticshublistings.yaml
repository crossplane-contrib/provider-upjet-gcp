                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier
                  and other resource reference fields. The fields that are in InitProvider
                  are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same
                  fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to avoid
                  updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after
                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                  and name of a Secret to which any connection details for this managed
                  resource should be written. Connection details frequently include
                  the endpoint, username, and password required to connect to the
                  managed resource. This field is planned to be replaced in a future
                  release in favor of PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both
                  could be set independently and connection details would be published
                  to both without affecting each other.
