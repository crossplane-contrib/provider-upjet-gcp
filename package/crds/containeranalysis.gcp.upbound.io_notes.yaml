                      for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given Note. It
                      also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
                      Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the
                      same project. Structure is documented below.

                            the name of a Note acts as its resource reference, it
                            is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the
