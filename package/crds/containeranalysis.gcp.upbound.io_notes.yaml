                      grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
                      gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
                      Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
                      Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
                      project.

                            resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical
                            name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
                            from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that

                            Attestations to verify.
