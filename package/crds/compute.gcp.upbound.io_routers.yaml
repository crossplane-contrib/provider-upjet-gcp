                            times the interval at which keepalive messages are sent,
                            and the hold time is the maximum number of seconds allowed
                            to elapse between successive keepalive messages that BGP
                            receives from a peer. BGP will use the smaller of either
                            the local hold time value or the peer's hold time value
                            as the hold time for the BGP connection between the two
                            peers. If set, this value must be between 20 and 60. The
                            default is 20.
