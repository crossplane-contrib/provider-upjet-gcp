                      numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.

                      is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning
                      (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise,
                      it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither
                      VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a
                      type that does not require verification or that this specific
                      channel has been exempted from verification because it was created
