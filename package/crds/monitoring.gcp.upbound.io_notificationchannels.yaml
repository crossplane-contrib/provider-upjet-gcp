                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                      is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters,
                      numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.

                      operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value
                      is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning
                      (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise,
                      it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither
                      VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a
                      type that does not require verification or that this specific
                      channel has been exempted from verification because it was created
                      prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This
