                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an

                                  When hive partition detection is requested,
                                  a common for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately
                                  before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following
                                  this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro

                                  partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix
                                  can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/.
                                  Note that when mode is set to CUSTOM, you must encode the partition key schema within the source_uri_prefix by setting source_uri_prefix to gs://bucket/path_to_table/{key1:TYPE1}/{key2:TYPE2}/{key3:TYPE3}.
