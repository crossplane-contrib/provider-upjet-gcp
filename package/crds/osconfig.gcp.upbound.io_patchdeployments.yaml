                            number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching,
                            a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is
                            notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption
                            time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch
                            steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its
                            patching operation fails either when applying the patches,
                            running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond
                            with a success notification before timing out. VMs that
                            are not running or do not have an active agent do not
                            count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone
                            rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded,
                            the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone
                            requires completion of the patch process in the previous
                            zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed
                            value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone,
                            the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until
                            the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully,
                            patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone.
                            If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job
                            stops. Structure is documented below.

                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after
                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                            number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching,
                            a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is
                            notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption
                            time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch
                            steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its
                            patching operation fails either when applying the patches,
                            running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond
                            with a success notification before timing out. VMs that
                            are not running or do not have an active agent do not
                            count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone
                            rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded,
                            the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone
                            requires completion of the patch process in the previous
                            zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed
                            value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone,
                            the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until
                            the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully,
                            patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone.
                            If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job
                            stops. Structure is documented below.

                            zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs
                            calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total
                            number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching,
                            a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is
                            notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption
                            time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch
                            steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its
                            patching operation fails either when applying the patches,
                            running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond
                            with a success notification before timing out. VMs that
                            are not running or do not have an active agent do not
                            count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone
                            rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded,
                            the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone
                            requires completion of the patch process in the previous
                            zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed
                            value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone,
                            the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until
                            the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully,
                            patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone.
                            If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job
                            stops. Structure is documented below.
