                      A subnet with purpose set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.
                      Note that REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.

                      A subnet with purpose set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.
                      Note that REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                      A subnet with purpose set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.
                      Note that REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.
                      If unspecified, the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918.

                      A subnet with purpose set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.
                      Note that REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.

                      A subnet with purpose set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.
                      Note that REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.

                      A subnet with purpose set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
                      A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.
                      Note that REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.
