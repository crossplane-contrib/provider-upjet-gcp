        description: CertificateTemplate is the Schema for the CertificateTemplates
          API. Certificate Authority Service provides reusable and parameterized templates
          that you can use for common certificate issuance scenarios. A certificate
          template represents a relatively static and well-defined certificate issuance
          schema within an organization.  A certificate template can essentially become
          a full-fledged vertical certificate issuance framework.

                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.
