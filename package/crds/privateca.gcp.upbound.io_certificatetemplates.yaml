        description: CertificateTemplate is the Schema for the CertificateTemplates
          API. Certificate Authority Service provides reusable and parameterized templates
          that you can use for common certificate issuance scenarios. A certificate
          template represents a relatively static and well-defined certificate issuance
          schema within an organization.  A certificate template can essentially become
          a full-fledged vertical certificate issuance framework.

                  and name of a Secret to which any connection details for this managed
                  resource should be written. Connection details frequently include
                  the endpoint, username, and password required to connect to the
                  managed resource. This field is planned to be replaced in a future
                  release in favor of PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both
                  could be set independently and connection details would be published
                  to both without affecting each other.
