                                                    Likelihood may never drop below VERY_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY_LIKELY, so applying an
                                                    adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY_LIKELY
                                                    will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.

                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an

                                                    will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
