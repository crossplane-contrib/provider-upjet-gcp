                      Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                      bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                      and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                      ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                      In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                      be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                      resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                      resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                      Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                      entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                      Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                      topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                      with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                      themselves.
                      Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                      Possible values are: PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR, PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.

                      Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                      implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                      configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                      This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                      actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences

                      Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and

                      and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                      ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                      In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                      be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                      resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                      resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                      Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                      entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                      Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                      topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data

                      for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                      Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                      implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                      configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                      This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                      actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                      between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                      bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

                      Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and

                      ONE regular Service Perimeter.

                      be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                      resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                      resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                      Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                      entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                      Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                      topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                      with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                      themselves.
                      Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                      Possible values are: PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR, PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.

                    description: |-
                      Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                      for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                      Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                      implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                      configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                      This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                      actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                      between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                      bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
