                      ("status") without actually enforcing them. This testing is

                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after
                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                      be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only
                      contains resources. Cross project operations are permitted if

                      spec is identical to the status for those Service Perimeters.
                      When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the implicit
                      spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a configuration
                      ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                      This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config
                      ("status") without actually enforcing them. This testing is
                      done through analyzing the differences between currently enforced
                      and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must bet set

                    description: 'Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two
                      types: regular and bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains
                      resources, access levels, and restricted services. Every resource
                      can be in at most ONE regular Service Perimeter. In addition
                      to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                      be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only
                      contains resources. Cross project operations are permitted if
                      all effected resources share some perimeter (whether bridge
                      or regular). Perimeter Bridge does not contain access levels
                      or services: those are governed entirely by the regular perimeter
                      that resource is in. Perimeter Bridges are typically useful
                      when building more complex topologies with many independent
                      perimeters that need to share some data with a common perimeter,
                      but should not be able to share data among themselves. Default

                      When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the implicit
                      spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a configuration
                      ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                      This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config
                      ("status") without actually enforcing them. This testing is
                      done through analyzing the differences between currently enforced
                      and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must bet set
                      to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default
