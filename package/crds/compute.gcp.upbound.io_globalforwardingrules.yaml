                      In their xDS requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node
                      metadata. If a match takes place, the relevant routing configuration
                      is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter
                      in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY,
                      at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding
                      label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is
                      set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
                      corresponding labels in the provided metadata. metadataFilters
                      specified here can be overridden by those specified in the UrlMap
                      that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies
