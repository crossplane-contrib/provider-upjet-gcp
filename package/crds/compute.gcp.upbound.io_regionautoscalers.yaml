                      If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based

                            initializing, during which the collected usage would not be

                            Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                            numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                            instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                            and time the startup process.

                      If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based

                            starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                            the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                            initializing, during which the collected usage would not be

                            Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                            numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                            instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                            and time the startup process.
