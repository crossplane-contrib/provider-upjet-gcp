      # OpenID Connect (OIDC)
      
      Using OIDC to authenticate to GCP eliminates the need to store credentials
      in this control plane. Instead, you will need to add Upbound as an identity
      provider in your GCP account, and then add it to an enabled identity pool. Go 
      through the following steps to add the identity provider.
      
      ## Creating an Identity Pool
      
      1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam).
      2. Select [Workload Identity Federation](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/workload-identity-pools)
      3. Select **Create Pool** and name it, for example `upbound-oidc-pool`.
      4. **Enable** the pool.
      
      ## Add Upbound IdP to the pool
      
      1. Select **Add a provider to pool** and then select **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** with the following details.
      ```
      Provider Name: upbound-oidc-provider
      Provider ID: upbound-oidc-provider (by default, this will be the same as the provider name)
      Issuer (URL): https://proidc.upbound.io
      ```
      2. Select **Allowed audiences** and add `sts.googleapis.com` for **Audience 1**.
      
      ## Optional: Configure provider attributes and conditions
      
      When Upbound authenticates to GCP it provides an OIDC subject (`sub`) of a managed control plane:
      `mcp:<account>/<mcp-name>:provider:<provider-name>`. GCP allows specifying conditions via CEL for
      more fine-grained control of your access scopes.
      
      1. In **Attribute Mapping**, configure `google.subject` to `assertion.sub`.
      2. Select **Attribute Conditions** > **Add Condition**. For example, to authenticate any control plane in the organization:
      ```
      google.subject.contains("mcp:<ORGANIZATION_NAME>")
      ```

      ## Create and grant access to service account
      
      To access GCP resources, pool identities will need to be granted access to a service account.
      The service account email will be used to create the ProviderConfig.

      Create the service account by following the steps in [Create a GCP Service Account](https://docs.upbound.io/quickstart/gcp-deploy/#create-a-gcp-service-account).

      To add the service account to the Workload Identity pool:

      1. Return to the Workload Identity Federation page and select your pool.
      2. Near the top of the page select Grant Access.
      3. Select the new service account, upbound-service-account.
      4. Under Select principals use All identities in the pool.

      See the [Upbound documentation](https://docs.upbound.io/all-spaces/legacy-spaces/multicloud-deploy/#connect-to-gcp-with-oidc)
      for more information on configuring OIDC with Upbound and GCP.
