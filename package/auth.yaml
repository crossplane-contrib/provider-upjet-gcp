      # Storing Credentials as a Kubernetes Secret
      
      GCP credentials may be supplied as a Kubernetes `Secret`. Credentials will
      be stored in this control plane and will only be accessible to installed
      providers.
      
      Credentials should be provided in the following format as a GCP Service Account keyfile:
      ```
      {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "PROJECT_ID",
        "private_key_id": "KEY_ID",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nPRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
        "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
      }
      ```
      
      See the [GCP
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete)
      for more information on how to generate credentials.

      # OpenID Connect (OIDC)
      
      Using OIDC to authenticate to GCP eliminates the need to store credentials
      in this control plane. Instead, you will need to add Upbound as an identity
      provider in your GCP account, and then add it to an enabled identity pool. Go 
      through the following steps to add the identity provider.
      
      ## Creating an Identity Pool
      
      1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam).
      2. Select [Workload Identity Federation](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/workload-identity-pools)
      3. Select **Create Pool** and name it, for example `upbound-oidc-pool`.
      4. **Enable** the pool.
      
      ## Add Upbound IdP to the pool
      
      1. Select **Add a provider to pool** and then select **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** with the following details.
      ```
      Provider Name: upbound-oidc-provider
      Provider ID: upbound-oidc-provider-id
      Issuer (URL): https://proidc.upbound.io
      ```
      2. Select **Allowed audiences** and add `sts.googleapis.com` for **Audience 1**.
      
      ## Optional: Configure provider attributes and conditions
      
      When Upbound authenticates to GCP it provides an OIDC subject (`sub`) of a managed control plane:
      `mcp:<account>/<mcp-name>:provider:<provider-name>`. GCP allows specifying conditions via CEL for
      more fine-grained control of your access scopes.
      
      1. In **Attribute Mapping**, configure `google.subject` to `assertion.sub`.
      2. Select **Attribute Conditions** > **Add Condition**. For example, to authenticate any control plane in the organization:
      ```
      google.subject.contains("mcp:<ORGANIZATION_NAME>")
      ```
      
      See the [Upbound documentation](https://docs.upbound.io/quickstart/gcp-deploy/#connect-to-gcp-with-oidc)
      for more information on configuring OIDC with Upbound and GCP.
